KVbench is developed based on original ForestDB-Benchmark. In order to support Samsung's native Key-Value SSD interface, and different workload requirements, we made following changes. Some features in the ForestDB-Benchmark may no longer be available. 


Features Added
============

 - KV SSD support: Direct access to Samsung's key-value SSD with various workloads and configurations, support suerspace driver, kernel space driver, and Samsung's key-value SSD emulator
 - Asynchronous IOs: async IO for KV SSD and aerospike, measure submission or completion latency
 - Multi-device support: kvbench can run on top of multiple devices
 - csv format output: run time performance can be printed out to a file in csv format
 - memory pool: use pre-allocated memory pool for keys and values to avoid frequent memory allocation
 - memory allocator: support different types of memory allocator: spdk, posix, and numa aware
 - Aerospike support: synchronous and asyncronous IOs benchmark for aerospike
 - RocksDB with user space driver: support benchmark on RocksDB's spdk version which talks to blobfs
 - sequential insertion: generate sequential insertion workload for multiple dabases or devices
 - insertion(pop) first: support workloads on an existing or empty database or device
 - value size control: support up to 5 different value lengths with ratio control in percentage
 - Additional operations: mixed workload of insert and deletion
 - print out interval: configurable run time performance print out interval
 - latency distribution: 99.99%
 - SNIA API support: KV SSD provides SNIA APIs implementation

Features Modified
============
 - read/write mixed workload ratio control in a single thread without random number generation
 - one-to-one mapping of database instance to device, not multi-database on a single device

Features Removed
============
 - fdb, leveldb, and wt engine is not fully tested on multi-device
 - multiple database instances on single device
 - compression ratio on fixed-length value size
