Release version 1.2.0

This package provides a generic interface for user to communicate with Samsung's Key Value SSD through different types of device drivers (user space, and kernel space), and a Samsung Key Value SSD emulator.

How to build:
    0. Install dependencies
       - ./tools/install_deps.sh
       - gcc version should be newer than v5.0
    1. mkdir build
    2. cd build
    3. Three types of driver are available for SNIA KV Storage API: kernel driver (KDD); emulator (EMU); user space driver (SPDK)
       User can compile one of them with following options:

       Kernel Device Driver
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_KDD=ON ../

       Emulator 
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_EMU=ON ../

       User Space Driver
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_SPDK=ON ../ 

       * Replace <main_source_dir>/lib/libkvnvmedd.a if there is newer version of spdk driver available or if user wants to rebuild the driver
       * The pre-build library is on gcc version 5.4.0
       * https://github.com/OpenMPDK/uNVMe v18.11

    4. make -j<# of jobs>
       * # of jobs: execute multiple recipes simultaneously

How to test
    library and test binaries are at:
    build/


    0. ./sample_code_async -h
       ./sample_code_sync -h
    
    1. Test with Kernel Driver
    - nvme kernel module needs to be compiled and installed

    sudo ./sample_code_async -d device_path [-n num_ios] [-q queue_depth] [-o op_type] [-k klen] [-v vlen]
    sudo ./sample_code_sync -d device_path [-n num_ios] [-o op_type] [-k klen] [-v vlen] [-t threads]

    e.g. ./sample_code_async -d /dev/nvme0n1 -n 100 -q 64 -o 1 -k 16 -v 4096

    2. Test with SPDK Driver
     - /KVSSD/PDK/core/tools/setup.sh
     - ./sample_code_async -d 0000:06:00.0 -n 100 -q 64 -o 1 -k 16 -v 4096
     - /KVSSD/PDK/core/tools/setup.sh reset
     
    PS: When test SNIA KV Storage API, make sure configuration file env_init.conf is in the upper directory of working directory
        SNIA KV Storage API configuration file env_init.conf and emulator configuration file kvssd_emul.conf are described in KVSSD_QUICK_START_GUIDE
